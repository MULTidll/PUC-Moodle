# Objective 1

Write a program to read two integer values and print true if both the numbers end with the same digit, otherwise print false. Example: If 698 and 768 are given, program should print true as they both end with 8. Sample Input 1 25 53 Sample Output 1 false Sample Input 2 27 77 Sample Output 2 true

# Objective 2

Objective 


In this challenge, we're getting started with conditional statements.

 

Task 


Given an integer, n, perform the following conditional actions:

 

·         If n is odd, print Weird

·         If n is even and in the inclusive range of 2 to 5, print Not Weird

·         If n is even and in the inclusive range of 6 to 20, print Weird

·         If n is even and greater than 20, print Not Weird

 

Complete the stub code provided in your editor to print whether or not n is weird.

 

Input Format

 

A single line containing a positive integer, n.

 

Constraints

 

·         1 < n < 100

 

Output Format

 

Print Weird if the number is weird; otherwise, print Not Weird.

 

Sample Input 0

 

3

 

Sample Output 0

 

Weird

 

Sample Input 1

 

24

 

Sample Output 1

 

Not Weird

 

Explanation

 

Sample Case 0:  n = 3

n is odd and odd numbers are weird, so we print Weird.



Sample Case 1:  n = 24

n > 20 and n is even, so it isn't weird. Thus, we print Not Weird.

# Objective 3

Three numbers form a Pythagorean triple if the sum of squares of two numbers is equal to the square of the third. For example, 3, 5 and 4 form a Pythagorean triple, since 3*3 + 4*4 = 25 = 5*5 You are given three integers, a, b, and c. They need not be given in increasing order. If they form a Pythagorean triple, then print "yes", otherwise, print "no". Please note that the output message is in small letters. Sample Input 1 3 5 4 Sample Output 1 yes Sample Input 2 5 8 2 Sample Output 2 no
