# Objective 1

The k-digit number N is an Armstrong number if and only if the k-th power of each digit sums to N.

 

Given a positive integer N, return true if and only if it is an Armstrong number.

 

Example 1:

 

Input:

 

153

 

Output:

 

true

 

Explanation:

 

153 is a 3-digit number, and 153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3.

 

Example 2:

 

Input:

 

123

 

Output:

 

false

 

Explanation:

 

123 is a 3-digit number, and 123 != 1^3 + 2^3 + 3^3 = 36.

 

Example 3:

 

Input:

 

1634

 

Output:

 

true

 

Note:

 

1 <= N <= 10^8

# Objective 3

A number is considered lucky if it contains either 3 or 4 or 3 and 4 both in it. Write a program to print the nth lucky number. Example, 1st lucky number is 3, and 2nd lucky number is 4 and 3rd lucky number is 33 and 4th lucky number is 34 and so on. Note that 13, 40 etc., are not lucky as they have other numbers in it.

 

The program should accept a number 'n' as input and display the nth lucky number as output.

 

Sample Input 1:

 

3

 

Sample Output 1:

 

33

 

Explanation:

 

Here the lucky numbers are 3, 4, 33, 34., and the 3rd lucky number is 33.

 

Sample Input 2:

 

34

 

Sample Output 2:

 

33344
